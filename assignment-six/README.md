# Install instructions  
These must be run in a bash terminal, within the `assignment six` directory
1. Create a virtual environment  
```python3 -m venv venv```
2. Enter the virtual environment
```source venv/bin/activate```
3. Install requirements
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

When running the Jupyter Notebook in VSCode, the VSCode workspace should be open directly in the assignment five folder. This allows VSCode to find and use the `venv` virtual environment.
